# QuickSnip
A simple, streamlined snipping tool for Windows.

### How do I use it?
Pin it to your taskbar and click it to take a screen snip

### What does it do?
It's a super simple screen snipping tool, works as you expect with a little more automation.
1. No UI to streamline it as much as possible, just click, then drag.
2. Automatically saves the image as a unique filename in `My Pictures\Snips` folder.
3. Automatically copies the image to the clipboard ready to paste into Discord for example.
4. Closes automatically (again, no UI, minimal interation from the user)
5. Saves as lossless PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format.
6. No hotkeys, no hooks, designed so it does not run in the background; Run it from the taskbar.

### Current limitations
- Want to add a settings menu to change some defaults
- Want to add support for video and screen recording with absolute minimal interaction
- Need to add support for multimonitor
- Need to check and handle DPI scaling
